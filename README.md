## Description

This is my first project assginment of creating a whole web application after 3 weeks in the bootcamp. The project incorporates both of these features: responsive web design and advanced CSS that I have been taught in the past 3 weeks. This is a much bigger picture than my last project that i had to spend much more time and also researched resources. Through out this project assignemnt, my knowlege and experience of Html and advaced css have improved alot more. I will need to do a alot more practices to become knowledgeable in web developing and this project helped me to get a foot in it.
## Installation 

I started out the html file with basic tags to sctrach out my ieads first. 
i drew out boxes for each individual sections and then started to work one by one.
for each htlm selector created, i also started to do its css styling so i could find out any errors right the way.
After all my codes worked properly on the web application , i started to do the Css Media Queries and i made adjustments to meet the requirements of the project.
## Usage

This is my start out web application page ,more functions and elements will be added to the web application through out the bootcamp.
